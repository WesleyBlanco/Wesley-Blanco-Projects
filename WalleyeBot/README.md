# Walleye Bot

This is the folder for Walleye Bot, a discord bot that my friends and I use. Its purpose is to access the Destiny API for Destiny information, act as a moderation tool and as a source for some memes. All commands of this bot are done within a discord server using the command '!' as a signal for the command. An example of this is !Walleye

## Current Commands
The following is the current commands that are in the source code

### Memes
Commands include, Walleye, Logan, Bryce, Zavala, Steve, Brandon, Luther, Luke, and Grant, as short one sentence jokes that are generally inside jokes for my friends and I.

### General Bot Commands
A help command that gives basic bot information and it's current version

### Moderation
a Purge command that purges the last X messages in the discord channel, where X is specificed by the user.

### Pokemon
!pokemon command. This command returns a pokemon's Dex number, type, Base stat total, attack, defense, hp, special attack, special defense and speed stats. It also shows an animated sprite of the pokemon from pokemondb.net. 

### Music
This bot can !play content from a youtube video. This uses the Youtube_DL library to search for a video and then play it in the discord voice channel or add it to the queue to be played. It can also skip the current content and leave the voice channel (which resets the queue).

### D2
This command when used with the first word of a Destiny 2 PvP map will return the visual photo of the map and a callout version of the map. 

## Acknowledgements
This bot uses a pokemons.json file that was taken from the following public github directory: https://github.com/joseluisq/pokemons
This bot's music section is heavily influenced by Youtuber "Pawel Bes"'s guide that he posted on his channel.

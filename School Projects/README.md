# Old School Projects

  This section of the repository is exclusively to show old programs I created at BGSU. There are 3 Projects in total and 3 Folders for them. These Projects are for Heap and Merge Sort, File access, and Class usage. 
  
  
### File Access
 
  This is one of the earliest programs I still have from college. It's goal is to compare BGSU tuition to other Ohio colleges. I maintain it in this repository as an example of my early programming style and commenting. 

### Heap and Merge Sort

  These cpp files will take in a file that holds numbers and will sort them. These programs do not output the resulting sorted files but instead outputs an output file that indicates, in order, total elements sorted, how many comparisons were made, and how long the sorting took. I maintain it in this repository as an example of my experience in alogrithms' efficiency and implimentation 
  
### Class Usage

  This is an older example of class usage but is (unfortunately) the best example of class usage that I have (In personal Projects, War the card game will have better implimentation of a class structure). This program takes in a file of instruments and returns out instruments that are not Brass or Strings.

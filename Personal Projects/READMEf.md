# Wesley Blanco Personal Projects

This folder will host personal projects that I've made for myself for use. Each Project that is in this Repository will have it's own folder, which will have a description below on what the project is for. If a project is in Development or in planning stages its name will have a (D) at the end. Any functionality listed with a (D) at the end indicates a functionality that is in development and not yet implimented. Anything that lacks the (D) near its name indicates its completion (As completed as some of these things can be. The discord bot and Morning Organizer will be updated continously as I need them to be). Programs mentioned in this README will have either (py) or (C++) next to their name to indicate what language they are programmed in. This Repository itself exists for the purposes of version control of my programs as a safety measure and also as a way to display my projects. 

## Folder Information

Each Project folder will hold the following

* An additional folder, called source code
  * This will include all the code for the Project
  * Code in these Programs may contain sensitve Data, this data will be replaced with the word REDACTED
* A README.md file that will describe in detail every aspect of the project's functionalities. 
* Another folder, called Dependencies, that will hold any files required for the Program to run
  * If there are no Dependencies, this folder will be absent
  * Dependency examples would be photos or JSON files

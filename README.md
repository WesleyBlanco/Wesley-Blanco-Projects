# Wesley-Blanco-Projects

Hello! This is the repository for Projects made by me, Wesley Blanco. This repository currently will host personal projects that I've made for myself for use. Each Project that is in this Repository will have it's own folder, which will have a description below on what the project is for. If a project is in Development its name will have a (D) at the end. Any functionality listed with a (D) at the end indicates a functionality that is in development and not yet implimented. This Repository itself exists for the purposes of version control of my programs as a safety measure and also as a way to display my projects.

## Folder Information

Each Project folder will hold the following

* An additional folder, called source code
  * This will include all the code for the Project
  * Code in these Programs may contain sensitve Data, this data will be replaced with the word REDACTED
* A README.md file that will describe in detail every aspect of the project's functionalities. 
* Another folder, called Dependencies, that will hold any files required for the Program to run
  * If there are no Dependencies, this folder will be absent
